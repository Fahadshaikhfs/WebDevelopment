                Online education is a flexible instructional delivery system that encompasses any kind of learning that takes place via the Internet. Online learning gives educators an opportunity to reach students who may not be able to enroll in a traditional classroom
                course and supports students who need to work on their own schedule and at their own pace. The quantity of distance learning and online degrees in most disciplines is large and increasing rapidly. Schools and institutions that offer online
                learning are also increasing in number.

                Humanity is facing unprecedented challenges. Critical issues, such as world conflicts, global warming, energy crises, and moral decay, if not dealt with, can bring a total breakdown of human civilization. We currently have all the tools to destroy our
                planet, either slowly by continuing to injure the physical environment or rapidly through nuclear warfare. We can annihilate not only our enemies but the whole human race and other species on Earth. <br />In the India and
                many other countries, educational systems are bogged down by structural problems and old philosophies.
